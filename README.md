# MYSchedule
**DH150 UX Design, Samantha Chiu**

----------------------

## Introduction: What is MYSchedule?

In this project, I will propose a ux design of a mobile app to enhance the aestetic and convenience experience of the scheduling community. The motivation of the project is to better manage our time as busy individuals going through our day. I will offer the accessibility and satisfactory of the user experience by creating 3 features I want to improve within this community and prototypes of how I will improve it.   

-------------------------

## Design Statement: 

Finding time to do everything you have to do in a day can be difficult when you do not have anything to note it down on. One of the biggest issues as students is that we never plan when we should do our homework and only know when the homework is due. Another issue is that we tend to overschedule ourselves and end up having to skip out on things because you did not know you over booked. Lastly, students want to hang out with their friends but people usually take forever to reply. My app, MYSchedule, will be able to resolve all of these issues by my project because I will be addressing each issue with a solution. MYSchedule tends to help other people with managing their time and going through their day more efficiently and productively.

## Website Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation

I chose to focus on two different communities for my heuristic evalution because I wanted to see which community I wanted to focus on for my project. For my evalution, I focused on UCLA's webpage, myUCLA.edu class planner and Craigslist. I aim to recognize, detect and analyze both the websites following Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design to identify usability problems. I ended up choosing myUCLA class planner because I personally felt most connected to the issues and community.

## Website Analysis: Usability Testing

The rationale behind the UT for myUCLA class planner website was because of the main user functionalities that I felt could be better. From looking at the list of the heuristic reviews, I felt that the website lacked in the flexibility and efficiency of use, consistency and standards, and the aesthetic and minimalist design. Therefore, I was hoping the UT can help find evidence that these specific areas of the website can be improved. The purpose of the usability testing aims to find out how to improve the web/app from user’s perspective.Task 1 will ask the user to find the classes they need to take for their major the next quarter. Task 2 will ask the user to enroll in their classes and Task 3 will ask the user to find specific classes. 

What I learned during the pilot test is that there could be many things that you might not expect the user to do and might be very unexpected, but the best thing to do is to go with the flow and make sure the user feels comfortable. Additionally, the pilot testing might take longer than expected because the user might be stuck on a certain question longer than others. What went well during the pilot testing was that the user did not give up and was able to go through all the tasks without feeling bad that they did not get every question. I wanted to make sure the user was comfortable and right, and that went really well. [read more...](https://github.com/samanthachiuu/DH150-Assignment1/tree/master/Assignment%202)

## User Research: Contextual Inquiry

The main activity my project would support is user’s time management and planning/scheduling habits. The basic need involved for the activity could be the users understanding of what works best for them when remembering events to go to and assignments to do. According to Maslow’s Hiearchy of Needs, the user would need psychological needs because they need to know what type of person they are and a feeling of accomplishment in order for them to want to have time management. The limitations that possibly would be improved with digital technology is that most people have their phones with them at all times, so if you were to use an online app like Google Calendar on your phone, you can input events whenever and it can send you alerts of the events (something that a physical planner cannot do).

## UX Storytelling: Persona + Scenario

All 3 of the personas are in college, but some are older and some are younger, where one of them is a freshmen of college, another is a third year student, and a 5th year part-time student. All three of the personas have their own problems that they want to be better at. Angie feels like she does not have time to do homework and wants to plan it better. Emmalee always overbooks her schedule and 2 events always overlap each other where she has to decide which one to go to. Crystal thinks that she is bothering her friends all the time asking when they are free and finding a time to meet.

## Wireframe and Initial Sketch

The three features I created from the journey map scenarios includes giving users the option to put in dedicated time to do their homework and to lock all social media apps throughout the time of homework. Another feature is a warning that popped up for the user when he or she scheduled something that overlapped another event that was scheduled. Lastly, my third feature is being able to see your contacts availabilities so that the user can see which days your friends are free to hangout and schedule them yourself.

## Low-fidelity Prototype

The purpose of this low-fidelity prototyping is to visualize what the features would look like and how users would interact with it. I am specifically just drawing out the main features that I want the users to focus on and this process will help me with my high-fidelity prototypes because I will have the foundation down. I decided to sketch my prototype on paper first and then digitally create it for my high-fidelity prototype.

## High-fidelity Prototype

The purpose of this high-fidelity prototype is so that the users testing it can visually see what it would look like if it were a real app come to life. The different tasks that the prototype demonstrates are scheduling time to do your homework and the option of locking social media applications as well if you have the app on your phone, getting a notification when you try to schedule multiple events at the same time or overlapping times so the user is aware of the time overlap, and being able to see your friends availability so you can schedule when to hangout with them or catch up. Building this prototype, I aim to improve the usability aspects of scheduling events in our everyday lives. I built my high-fidelity prototype on Figma and created all the screens and components on there as well from feedback from usability testing and my wireframes.
